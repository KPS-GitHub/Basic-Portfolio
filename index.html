            <p>I've always had a love for all things analytical and logic-oriented. Ever since "grass is to green as sky is to ________", I was hooked on solving puzzles of all forms. Whether it be a crossword puzzle or a math homework problem, I couldn't get enough of having a problem and working my way towards the answer. After all, humans are chemically rewarded for solving problems in the same way we are chemically rewarded for eating or making friends; it makes us happy. This is what lead me to pursuing a degree in mathematics. After all, math problems are simply puzzles with numbers.<p/>
            <br>
            <p>Upon reaching college, I began my education as an engineering major, but two and a half years in I faced the fact that, as great as an engineering career is, it simply wasn't for me. Upon discovering the amazing world of statistics, I knew what I wanted to do and there was no turning back. My future was in working with numbers and there was no telling me otherwise. Now I have graduated from Colorado State University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a concentration of Actuarial Science. I am pursuing a career that utilizes my logical and analytical skills while also hopefully being able to help out others along the way, whether that means I get to help people directly through my job or in other ways such as donating to and volunteering with charities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a nutshell, I love people, numbers, logical problems to solve, and I can't wait to start a career path that will eventually unite all three.</p>
